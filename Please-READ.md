---- General Idea ----

I worked with Industrial Air Filtration Systems, Projects, and Technical Sales while I was working as a Sales Engineer for Conquest Equipment Corp (2018-2021). 
The company is an exclusive distributor of the Donaldson Dust Control Equipment in Western Canada and I had to select and size a specific model, size, options 
and features of the exact Donaldson Dust Collector that meets all the project and technical requirements. At that time I was thinking that it would be great 
to have an application that makes the equipment selection process easier and faster. So this project shows the idea of what I would be happy to have when I was 
working with the Donaldson equipment.
Note: This application has one parameter – The number of filter bags, however, in fact, there is a big number of input parameters, as well as site conditions, etc. 
So in my application, I just took one parameter, to show the idea. However, many more options may be added and the sort\selection module may be expanded.


---- Website ----

Once you visit the website, the user will see the Welcome page and Authorization which is operated by Firebase. There are a few options in the Menu where the user 
can learn more about the Donaldson Company and learn more about the RP Dust Collector. The main option is to proceed with the RP model review. As mentioned above, 
on the selection page the user can select the ‘main’ parameter of the estimated number of filters required. Users can choose all models available (in fact, there 
are more RP exist, I just took some of them) or sort them by groups. Each RP collector can be clicked and the user is allowed to review the selected RP model 
General drawing with all the technical specifications and decide if this is the model he needs for the project, or if he should review other models.
Once the user decided which RP model is preferable for his project, he can save some notes for himself, in case he wanted to remind which RP model was selected 
for one of the projects and why. Once form is completed, the user can print it on paper or save it as a PDF on his local storage.
